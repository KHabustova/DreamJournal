## Dream Journal 💤

A simple and clean dream journaling app built with Spring Boot (backend) and React + TailwindCSS (frontend).
It supports basic CRUD operations—create, read, update, and delete dream entries.

For simplicity and ease of setup, it currently uses an embedded H2 database.

Users can:

    📝 Add a new dream entry

    ✏️ Edit existing dreams

    ❌ Delete entries they no longer want

Deployed with Fly.io (backend) and Netlify (frontend).
A locally runnable version is available under Releases. This version uses a lightweight Python 3 server, so you'll need to have Python, in addition to Java, installed on your system to run it.
